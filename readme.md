This is a simple Firefox extension I made. Its a Pomodoro timer, that lets you interact through controls and shows up on every new tab. 

To add this extension on Firefox:

1. Clone this repo.

2. Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox on your browser.

3. Click Load Temporary add-on icon and select the manifest.json file in /everyday from the folder selector.

4. You might need to provide permissions. 

After that's done, click on the Extensions icon and enable it.

5. That's it, now you'll see the timer when every new tab opened.

Read my blog on how I built this:
